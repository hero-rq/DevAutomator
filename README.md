# DevAutomator

DevAutomator is an AI-powered automated development pipeline that integrates planning, building, testing, deployment, and documentation generationâ€”all orchestrated by specialized agents empowered by the OpenAI API.

## Overview

DevAutomator streamlines your development process by:
- **Planning:** Breaking down your developing ideas into actionable tasks.
- **Building:** Compiling and generating project code.
- **Testing:** Running unit tests and providing suggestions for improved coverage.
- **Deployment:** Packaging and deploying your project to target environments.
- **Documentation:** Generating and updating project documentation automatically.

The system is designed to be run with a single command, making it easy to initiate the entire development process from the command line.
